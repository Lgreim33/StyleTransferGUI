This is project is a continuation of previous work in arbitrary style transfer. The model is a simple encoder-decoder model, with ADAIN and CBAM componeents to apply the style transfer. For a more in depth explanation of the model as well as performance metrics,
review the paper I wrote that discusses the implementation.


To run the model on your own image files, you will want to download the gui application written in Java.
